Groupy - Group Self Service Made Simple

Groups are often the link between users and their permissions in various applications.
When your organisation grows, so does the burden on your administrators to manage groups and group memberships for their growing number of users.
This is where Groupy comes in. Groupy empowers users to create/update/delete their own groups as well as gives them the required visibility to decide which groups they want to request membership of.
This self service lowers operational overhead on administrators but at the same time gives them full control over what users/owners can do with their groups (permission to create/update/delete, grant membership only after admin approval etc).

Groupy is desidned to work with OpenLDAP, Active Directory or any LDAP compliant user store and can be deployed as a container in Kubernetes(preferred) alongside your other workloads. Access to Groupy is secured with oAUTH2 (planned: or via https://www.privacyidea.org/) so you can rest assured that only authenticated users are allowed to access the application.

Groupy is 100% open source and free to use.

## Timeline

Groupy's development is planned to start in September 2020.
